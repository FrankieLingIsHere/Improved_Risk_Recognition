"At 1:15 p.m. on April 21, 2022, a Contractor was hired by a homeowner of a single-story residential property to perform renovations and build an addition to the existing structure. This involved miscellaneous demolition work and construction of foundations and footings, and framing. The employee and a coworker, his son, were assigned to demolish the existing fireplace and indoor BBQ wall and chimney between the kitchen and the living room. These structures consisted of bricks and cement masonry units structurally supported by a wall. The chimney went through the roof. The employee and coworker were demolishing the wall and chimney from the bottom up inside of the kitchen with a rotary hammer.
